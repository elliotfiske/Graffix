HI I'M ELLIOT FISKE

Pretty standard stuff here, I guess.

2 meshes, both of them are bunnies.  One of them is dancing around the x and y axis.  The light is represented by a tiny, tiny light bunny.

All controls and stuff are according to the spec.

My fourth material is a gray sheet metal with a red specular reflection.  it looks like cool lava or something.
